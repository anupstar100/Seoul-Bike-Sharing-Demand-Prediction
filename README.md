# Seoul-Bike-Sharing-Demand-Prediction

## ***Problem Statement***
Data provided by Seoul Bike Sharing Company. These public bikes are made available to
the persons who are 15 and older. Seoul bike docking stations are equipped in excessive
traffic areas including subway entrances/exits, bus stops, residential complexes, public
offices, schools, and banks. Docking stations are computerized stands for the purpose of
pickup and drop off of the rental bikes. Users of Seoul public bikes can rent and return
rental bikes at any docking station.

The main objective is to build a model which can predict the number of bikes required
each hour. This would help the company to made bike available for rent on the basis of
future demand.
## ***Introduction***
In a span of few decades, the sharing of bicycle system has seen enormous growth
(Fishman, 2016). This system is a recently developed transportation system which
provides people with bicycle for common use. Bicycle system provides user to rent a
bike from one docking station, where user can ride and then return in another docking
station. Amsterdam in Netherlands was the one where initial bicycle sharing system has
started in 1965 (Shaheen, Guzman, & Zhang, 2010). Main motive of the system was to
focus on environmental and social welfare. With enormous advancement of Intelligent
Transportation System and information technology after 2000s, this bicycle system
employed globally. Situation over decade has changed in sharing bicycle. Today it is
much easier for the public to rent bicycles. Global Positioning System enabled mobile
application allows people to know the nearby bicycle station for renting the bicycle.

Till today there are more than 50 countries having 712 which implemented bicycle
sharing method (Shaheen, Martin, Cohen, Chan, & Pogodzinski, 2014). They have now
found to be important face of transportation system in major cities due to several factors
such as health problems, heavy traffic and environmental conditions. Bike sharing
Systems namely OFO and Mo-bike in places like Beijing has enabled people to find
position of unused bicycle and use them. Once the bicycle is used, it can be locked at any
docking station across the city. For expanding availability of bicycle for public use, the
operators running this service allocate a truck that collects bicycles parked in various
station and relocate them to the original station gradually (Schuijbroek, Hampshire, &
Van Hoeve, 2017). There are number of policy issues involved in the management of
intelligent bicycle sharing system (Gast, Massonnet, Reijsbergen, & Tribastone, 2015).

Many countries have bike sharing system, such as Ddareungi is a bike sharing system in
South Korea, which started in the year 2015, known as Seoul bike in English. It was
started to overcome issues like greater oil prices, congestion in traffic and pollution in
the environment and to develop a healthy environment for citizen of Seoul to live. Han
River is the initial place where Ddareungi was first started on October 2015 in Seoul,
few months later, total number of bike â€“ sharing station touched 150 with as much as
1500 were there. In order to cover the entire people in Seoul, in 2016 there is a gradual
incline in number of docking station. As large as 20,000 bikes were made available which
was confirmed by Seoul Mayor Park won-soon. With the help of growing technologies,
Seoul city is now equipped with 1500 bike renting station which are operational round
the clock. With the help of internet-enabled device or mobile phone, people can know
the number of bikes available for the people to rent. Bike are locked which can be
unlocked with the help of
password which people
accessing to it will receive
the password through mail.
Users are allowed and can
rent and leave the bike in
any station. Seoul Rental
Bikes are built to be utilized
by all kinds of people
including women, elderly
persons and infirm. Seoul
Bikes are manufactured
using durable and light-weight materials. This giving user more stability in driving and
convenience. Users can verify their trip details (distance, duration) and measure of
bodily activities (burnt calories) at My Page > Usage Details. With this kind of smart
technology and convenience, the use of Rental bike is increasing every day. So, there is
a need to manage the bike rental demand and manage the continuous and convenient
service for the users. This study proposes a data mining-based approach including
weather data to predict whole city public bike demand. A rule-based model is used to
predict the number of rental bikes needed at each hour. The following figure presents
the picture of rental bike stations in Seoul.
